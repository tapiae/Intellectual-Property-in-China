  <h1> China's Intellectual Property Rights </h1>
  <p> China should be praised for their Intellectual Property protections that they offer.
    The protections of intellectual property was established by the government legislation,and administrative regulations to decrease the 
    areas of trademark and copyright.China's intellectual property protections led to the creation of protecting both local and foreign
    intellectual property.China has been very enforceful to the IPR protections and it has increased over the past five years.
    China created these protections since the White House wanted all companies to feel safe shipping their products across the sea to 
    China and not having them be stolen once they get on their land.So China focused on ensuring that the goods are protected and respected 
    to where they are not infirnged on and that there are consequences for infringement.

  <h2> Solution for admonishing China's Intellectual Property rights</h2>
  <p> A solution for admonishing the IPR would be now there would not be as many issues as there was when having these rghts.One issue was the
    cost of money that China had to spend to bring companies products to China.</p>
